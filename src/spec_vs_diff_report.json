The core data layer is present but the user-facing interfaces are missing.",

The BuildRequest explicitly requires using existing AdminSubscriptionPlansManagement.tsx component, but it's not shown as added or modified. Backend methods exist (createSubscriptionPlan, updateSubscriptionPlan, deleteSubscriptionPlan) and hooks are in useQueries.ts, but the actual admin UI component is missing.",
