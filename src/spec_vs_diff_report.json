  "summary": "Diff implements the homepage landing hero logo swap and adds substantial podcast show/episode UI plus an admin podcasts tab, along with backend stable-state migration scaffolding. However, the diff also includes multiple unrelated admin/artist/fee/verification changes not requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend must enforce that only the show owner can add episodes to that show.",
      "reason": "Frontend adds episode creation UI and query hooks, but the diff summary does not provide evidence of backend authorization checks for episode creation (e.g., explicit owner check/guard in backend/main.mo). Because backend/main.mo is truncated, this cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Non-admin users cannot access admin podcast submissions views.",
      "reason": "Admin UI for podcast submissions is added, and AdminDashboard includes a Podcasts tab, but the diff summary does not show any explicit role-guarding logic for the podcast submissions view itself. If access control exists elsewhere, it is not evidenced here.",
