  "summary": "Frontend changes implement admin-aware post-login routing from the Landing Page and add route protection on the Admin Dashboard with an English toast + redirect. Backend changes are present but the provided diff excerpt for backend/main.mo does not contain evidence of restoring admin privileges for the specified account or ensuring persistence across upgrades.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore administrator recognition for the account associated with the email address \"yeetmusictamil@gmail.com\" so that this account is treated as an admin by the backend authorization layer (and admin status persists across upgrades, with migration if needed).",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is modified but the truncated snippet only shows imports and type definitions; there is no visible change demonstrating that AccessControl.isAdmin (or equivalent) is restored for the target Principal, nor any visible upgrade-persistence or migration logic.",
