# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement subscription plans management system with admin controls and public display.

**Planned changes:**
- Add admin interface for creating, editing, and deleting subscription plans (name, pricing, benefits, redirect URL)
- Display all active subscription plans on the landing page in the existing PricingSection component
- Enable public visibility of subscription plans for all visitors

**User-visible outcome:** Admins can manage subscription plans through the dashboard, and all visitors can view available subscription plans with pricing and benefits on the landing page.
