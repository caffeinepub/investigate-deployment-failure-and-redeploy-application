  "summary": "The implementation covers all core requirements for the simplified link in bio feature. The data model includes Spotify and Apple Music link fields, the admin interface has a 'Manage Links' dialog with URL validation, public song pages display streaming platform buttons with proper branding, and access control restricts public pages to 'live' status songs. However, the diff does not show evidence of using the existing ArtistNameWithVerified component for displaying artist names with verification badges on the public song page, and there is no evidence that the required platform logo images exist in the frontend/public/assets/generated directory.",
